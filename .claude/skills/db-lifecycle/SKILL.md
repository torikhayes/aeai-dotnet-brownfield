## Instructions

Read the full database lifecycle guide at `.github/agents/db-lifecycle.agent.md` and follow all instructions, commands, and known-error resolutions defined there.

The `.github/agents/db-lifecycle.agent.md` file is the single source of truth for database lifecycle operations and is shared with GitHub Copilot. Do not duplicate its content here.

## Operations

The guide covers four operations:

- **A — Check migration status**: List defined migrations and inspect which are applied against the live database.
- **B — Run migrations**: Apply pending migrations automatically (via AppHost startup) or manually via `dotnet ef database update`.
- **C — Seed data**: Trigger automatic seeding on first startup, or force a re-seed by truncating target tables.
- **D — Run the app**: Start the full stack with `dotnet run --project src/eShop.AppHost/eShop.AppHost.csproj`.

## User Input

```text

```

Use the user input to determine which operation to focus on. If empty, present all four operations and ask which the user needs.
